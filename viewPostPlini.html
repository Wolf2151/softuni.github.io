                    <p>Plini is a guitarist and composer based in Sydney, Australia. His main genre influences are Instrumental rock and Progressive metal, but there are elements of other genres in his songs. He is even considered part of the Djent scene, and has played a tour with Animals As Leaders, and Intervals. His first officially released single was Moonflower (October, 2012) through his bandcamp account and 2 years later in his YouTube channel. The proceeding single was 1745 7381 3265 2578 (January, 2013), in which he experimented a bit, adding Electronic music parts. The first EP he released was Other Things (March, 2013) featuring 3 songs. After this EP his reputation began to raise, and he began to attract attention from listeners and artists of the Instrumental Progressive Metal scene. The following releases were the single Cloudburst (June, 2013), and the second EP Sweet Nothings (October, 2013), which focused on a cleaner and softer sound. Right after that he released a split EP along with Sithu Aye named I (November, 2013). The EP was divided into 2 songs per artist. The album opened with "Orm" and "Rupture" from Plini and closed with Sithu's songs.The following releases were the single Cloudburst (June, 2013), and the second EP Sweet Nothings (October, 2013), which focused on a cleaner and softer sound.

                        Plini's most famous single Atlas (March, 2014) was a great success, and became even more famous with the playthrough video he released in May of the same year. This song became the "anthem" of this artist and was played live in NAMM 2016.

                        After that, the single Ko Ki (September, 2014) was the last song released that year.

                        In the next year he released The End Of Everything (March, 2015) which was the last chapter to the "Things" EPs, as the 3 albums were supposed to have been released as one full-length album, but ended up being released as 3 different EPs.

                        After a year Plini released the single Every Piece Matters (February, 2016) which was the first to take part in an album, which was Handmade Cities (August, 2016), the first full-length album by him, which has 7 tracks and was followed by a tour with Animals As Leaders and Intervals (named "Plintervals" by the fan base during the tour). The album was praised by critics of Ultimate Guitar, SputnikMusic, It Djents and even by Steve Vai.

                        In 2017 the "Handmade Cities Tour" will be held and will begin in Europe.</p>
